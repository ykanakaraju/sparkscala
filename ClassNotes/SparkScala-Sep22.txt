  Scala Programming language
  --------------------------

  -> Scala is a multi-paradigm programming language

	-> Scala is functional programming language
	-> Scala is a pure object oriented programming language
		    
     
  -> Scala is pure object oriented programming language

	-> Scala has no primitives
	-> Scala has no operators
	-> Everything in Scala is a 'instance' of some class/trait
	-> All operators are methods in scala.


  -> Scala Types

	-> immutable : unchangable, use 'val'
	-> mutable : changable, use 'var'


  -> Type declaration

	val i : Int = 10
	val name : String = "Raju"
	val flag : Boolean = true
	val hobbies : List[Int] = List("cricket", "chess", "reading")


  -> Scala infers the types based on the value assigned. 

	val i = 10
	val name = "Raju"
	val flag = true
	val hobbies = List("cricket", "chess", "reading")


  -> Scala is a statically typed language

	-> The data type of every variable is determined at compile time.
	-> Once declared, the type can not be changed.


  ->  Scala Blocks

	-> A block is a set of statements enclosed in  { .. }
	-> A block returns a value
	-> The return value of the block is the value of the last executed statement/expression.


  -> Scala 'Unit'

	-> In Scala, Unit is an object that has no value
        -> Printed as "()"
 

  -> Scala Class Heirarchy

	    Any => AnyVal => Int, Long, Double, Boolean, Char, Unit, ...
		=> AnyRef => String, List, Seq, .....


  -> String interpolations

	's' interpolator
	
		val str = s"Name: $name, Age:${age + 10}, Height: $height"
  		println(str)

	'f' interpolator => s + formatting chars

		 val str = f"Name: $name, Age:$age, Height: $height%2.2f"
  		println(str)

	'raw' interpolator => s + escapes the escape chars

  		val str = raw"E:\newdir\table1.txt"
  		println(str)


  -> Input & Output


	   val name = StdIn.readLine("What is your name?")   
	   println(name)
	   
	   print("What is your age?")
	   val age = StdIn.readInt()
		
           ---------------------------------

	   printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Height: %4.2f", name, age, height)


  -> Flow Control Constructs

	
      	if..else

		val ageGroup = if (age < 13) "Child"
			  else if (age < 20) "Teenager"      
			  else if (age < 60) "Adult"      
			  else "Senior"
     

	match..case
	
		ageGroup = age match {
			case x if ( x < 13 ) => s"child ($x)"
			case x if ( x < 20 ) =>  s"teenager ($x)"
			case x if ( x < 60 ) =>  s"adult ($x)"
			case _ => { "senior" }
		  }     


  -> Range Object

	Range(1, 10) => 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
	Range(1, 10, 2) => 1,3,5,7,9
	1 until 10 by 2 => 1,3,5,7,9
	1 to 10 => 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (Range.Inclusive)
        1 until 10 => 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
	1 to 11 by 2 => 1,3,5,7,9,11 (Range.Inclusive)
	1 until 11 by 2 => 1,3,5,7,9


  Loops
  ------
     
      	while
	------
		var x = 20
		  
		  
		  while ( x > 0 ) {
			println(x)
			
			x -= 1
		  }


	do..while
  	---------
		var x = 20  
		  do {
			println(x)    
			x -= 1
		  } while ( x > 0 )


	foreach
	--------
		List("Scala", "Python", "Java").foreach( x => println( x.toUpperCase ) )
		(1 to 100 by 2).foreach(println)


	for
	----
		
		// simpl e for loop
		for( a <- 1 to 10 ) {
		   println(s"a = $a")
		}
		
		// nested for loop
		for( a <- 1 to 10; b <- 1 until 20 by 5; c <- List("Scala", "Python") ) {
			println(s"a = $a, b = $b, c=$c")
		}

		// for loop with guards
		for( a <- 1 to 10 if (a%2 == 0); b <- 0 to 10 by 2 if (b > a) ) {
			println(s"a = $a, b = $b")
		}

		//for comprehension
		val v1 = for( a <- 1 to 10 ) yield((a, a*2))


  Exception handling
  ------------------

	try {
	    ... some code ...
	}
	catch {		
           case e1: FileNotFoundException => { ... }
	   case e2: IOException => { ... }
	   case e3: Exception => { ... }
	}
	finally {
		...
	}	


  Collections
  ------------

	Three types of collections

	1. Sequences -> Ordered collection whose objects can be accessed using index

		1.1 IndexedSeq => Array, ArrayBuffer, Vector, Range
			-> Good of random access of the elements

		1.2 LinearSeq => List, ListBuffer, Stream, Queue
			-> Good for iterations and loops


	2. Map -> Collection of (key, value) pairs

		val m1 = Map( 1 -> 10, 2 -> 20, 5 -> 50, 9 -> 90 )

		m1(1) => 10
		m1(10) => java.util.NoSuchElementException: key not found: 10

		m1.get(1) => Some(10)
		m1.get(10) => None

		m1.getOrElse(1, 0) => 10
		m1.getOrElse(2, 0) => 20
		m1.getOrElse(10, 0) => 0


	3. Set -> Unordered collection of unique objects


  Option  : represents an object which may or may-not have a value.

	If there is a value, Option will return "Some" object
	If there is no value, Option will return "None" object

	val x : Option[Int] => Some(Int) or None


  Tuple :    Is an object that holds multiple elements of different types
	     Tuple is not a collection
	     A tuple with two elements id called a 'Pair'   

	val t1 = (1, 1.5, true, 10, List(1,1), ("Hi", 10.5))
	
	t1._1   => 1
	t1._3 => true
	t1._6._2 => 10.5



  Methods and Procedures
  ----------------------
   
     => Reusable code blocks

     => Method returns somes output
	Procedure returns no output (Returns 'Unit')
   


      Methods
      -------

		 def sum(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) : Int = {       
		   a + b + c 
		 }
		
              	 // calling by position
		 val s = sum(10, 20, 30)		 
		 println(s"s = $s")

		 // calling by name
		 val s = sum(b=10, a=20, c=30)

		 // mixing positional and named params
	         // postitional params must be given first
		 def sum(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int, d: Int) : Int = {   
		   println(s"a = $a, b = $b, c = $c, d = $d")   
		   a + b + c + d
		 }
		
		 val s = sum(10, 20, d=30, c=40)

		 // methods with default values
		 def sum(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int=0, d: Int=0) : Int = {   
		   println(s"a = $a, b = $b, c = $c, d = $d")   
		   a + b + c + d
		 }
		
		 val s = sum(10, 20, 30, 40)
		 val s = sum(10, 20, 30)
		 val s = sum(10, 20)
		 val s = sum(10, 20, d=50)

		//methods with variable length arguments
		def sum(a: Int, b: Int*) : Int = {        
			  var sum = 0
			  var i = 1
			  
			  println(s"a = $a")
			  
			  for( x <- b ){
				println(s"b $i = $x")
				sum += x
				i += 1
			  }          
			  sum + a          
		 }
		
		 val s = sum(10)
		 
		 println(s"s = $s")

   		 // recursive methods
		 def factorial(n: Int): Long = {  
			  if (n <= 1)
				 1  
			  else    
				 n * factorial(n - 1)
		 }				
		 println( factorial(5) )


	Procedures
        ----------
		def printInABox(s: String) {     
			val line = "-" * s.length()
			println("----" + line + "\n| " + s + " |\n" + line + "----")
		}
	   
		printInABox("Spark is a framework") 


  Functions
  ---------
	
	-> A functional programming language treats a function like a literal.
	-> A function is anonymous by nature

		(<zero or more args>) => { ..some block of code }
		(a : Int, b: Int) => a + b 

		println( (a : Int, b: Int) => a + b,  ((a : Int, b: Int) => a + b)(10, 20)  )

	-> A function can be assigned to a variable (called named function)

	-> A function can be passed as an argument to a function or method

			def f1(a: Int, b: Int, f: (Int, Int) => Int) = f(a, b)
			
			val f2 = (a: Int, b: Int, f: (Int, Int) => Int) => f(a, b)
			
			val sum = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y
			val prod = (x: Int, y: Int) => x * y
			val q = (x: Int, y: Int) => x / y
			
			def sum1(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
				
			println( f2(20, 3, sum1) )

	-> A function/method can return a function

			def calculate(op : String) = {      
			  op match {
				case "+" => (a: Int, b: Int) => a + b
				case "-" => (a: Int, b: Int) => a - b
				case "*" => (a: Int, b: Int) => a * b
				case "/" => (a: Int, b: Int) => a / b
				case _ => (a: Int, b: Int) => a % b
			  }
			}
			 
			val s = calculate("+")
			val p = calculate("*")
			val m = calculate("blah")
			
			println( m(100, 30) ) 


	Function literal				Function Type
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	(a: Int) => a * a				Int => Int
	(s: String) => s.length				String => Int
	(a: Int, b: Int) => a + b			(Int, Int) => Int
	(s: String) => println(s)			String => Unit
	() => "Windows 10"				() => String
	(a: Int, b: Int) => List(a, b)			(Int, Int) => List[Int]
	(a: (Int, Int), b: (Int, Int)) 			((Int, Int), (Int, Int)) => (Int, Int)
	   => (a._1 + b._1, a._2 + b._2)
	(a: Int, b: Int, f: (Int, Int) => Int) 		 (Int, Int, (Int, Int) => Int) => Int
			=> f(a, b)


  Higher Order Functions
  ----------------------
   => HOFs are those that take a function (or method) as a parameter or those that return a function.


  1. map		P: U => V
			Transforms an input collection to an output collection by applying the function
			object to object transformation.

			val l1 = List(1,2,3,6,4,3,5,6,9,6,5,8).map( x = x*10 )


  2. filter		P: U => Boolean
			Returns an output collection by filtering the input collection based on the function

			val l1 = List(1,2,3,6,4,3,5,6,9,6,5,8).filter( x = x > 4 )


  3. reduce		reduceLeft (reduce) & reduceRight
			P: (U, U) => U
			Reduces an entire collection to a single value of the same type by iterativly 
			appying the function

			List(1,2,3,6,4,3,5,6,9,6,5,8).reduceLeft( (x, y) = x + y )
			List(1,2,3,6,4,3,5,6,9,6,5,8).reduceRight( (x, y) = x + y )

		
  4. mapValues		P: U => V
			Operates only on map objects
			Transforms the value part of the key-value pairs		

			val m1 = Map( 1 -> 10, 2 -> 20, 3 -> 30, 4 -> 40 )
			val m2 = m1.mapValues(v => (v, 1))
			m2: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,(Int, Int)] = Map(1 -> (10,1), 2 -> (20,1), 3 -> (30,1), 4 -> (40,1))


  5. flatMap		P: U -> GenTranversableOnce[V]
			flatMap flattens the iterables returned by the function.

			val l1 = Source.fromFile("E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt").getLines.toList
			val words = l1.flatMap(x => x.split(" ")) 
			


  6. sortWith		P: U => <binary sorting expression>
			Elements of the collection are sorted based on the binary sorting function

			words.sortWith( (x,y) => x.length < y.length )


  7. groupBy		P: U => V
			Returns a map, where
				key: each unique value of the function output
				values: Iterable with all the values that produced the key.

			words.groupBy(x => x).mapValues( _.length )
			


   Use-Case: Wordcount program using Scala HOFs

	val file = raw"E:\Spark\wordcount.txt"
     
        val data = Source.fromFile(file)
                 .getLines
                 .flatMap(x => x.split(" "))
                 .toList
                 .groupBy(w => w)
                 .mapValues(l => l.length)
                 .toList
                 .sortWith( (x,y) => x._2 > y._2 )
                 


   Object Oriented Programming in Scala
   -------------------------------------

	-> class   	=> class, case class, abstract class, sealed class
	-> object	=> object, case object
	-> trait
	-> package object


   Class
   -----
	-> In Scala, a class is not declared as public. 
	-> A Scala source file can contain multiple classes, and all of them have public visibility. 
	-> All class methods and properties are 'public' by default
	-> Scala provides getter and setter methods for every field.
	-> A class can inherit (extend) only one other class. 
	-> A class can extend multiple traits
	

   Constructors
   -------------

	-> In Scala, every class should have one primary constructor 
	    and optionally  additional auxiliary constructors.

	-> The auxiliary constructors are defined with method 'this'. 
	   Each auxiliary constructor must start with a call to a previously defined 
	   auxiliary constructor or the primary constructor.

	-> In Scala, every class has a primary constructor. 
	   The primary constructor is not defined with a this method. 
	   It is interwoven with the class definition.

	-> The parameters of the primary constructor are placed immediately after the class name. 
	   The primary constructor executes all statements in the class definition.



	import scala.io._
	import scala.math._

	object Demo1 extends App {
				
		val p1 = new Person()                	// calling PC
		p1.setName("Raju")
		p1.setAge(45)
		p1.printProperties()
			
		println("-------------------------")
		
		val p2 = new Person(2)              	// calling AC 1
		p2.setName("Ramesh")
		p2.setAge(35)
		p2.printProperties()
		
		println("-------------------------")   
		
		val p3 = new Person(3, "Ravi")     	// calling AC 2
		p3.setAge(35)
		p3.printProperties()
		
		println("-------------------------") 
		
		val p4 = new Person(3, "Rajesh", 25)     // calling AC 2
		p4.printProperties()
		
	}

	class Person {  
	   
	   private var _id = -1
	   private var _name = "Anonymous"
	   private var _age = -1  
	   
	   println("Executing primary constructor")
	   //println(_id, _name, _age)
	   
	   // AC - 1
	   def this(id: Int) {
		 this()       // calling PC
		 this._id = id
		 println("Executing auxiliary constructor with no parameters")
	   }
	   
	   // AC - 2
	   def this(id: Int, name: String) {
		 this(id)
		 this._name = name
		 println("Executing auxiliary constructor with 2 parameters")
	   }
	   
	   // AC - 3
	   def this(id: Int, name: String, age: Int) {
		 this(id, name)
		 this._age = age
		 println("Executing auxiliary constructor with 3 parameters")
	   }
		  
	   def getId = _id   
	   //def setId(id: Int) = this._id = id
	   
	   def getName = _name
	   
	   def setName(name: String) = this._name = name
	   
	   def getAge = _age
	   
	   def setAge(age: Int) = {
		 if (this._age < age) this._age = age     
	   }
	   
	   def printProperties() {
		 println(s"id = ${_id}, name=${_name}, age=${_age}")
	   }
	}


  Object
  ------
    
	-> Object is a singleton entity
	-> Objects will have only singleton methods
	-> Object can have only primary constructor (no aux. constructor)
	-> The PC of the object is invoked the first time the object is referenced.   

	object Address {
	  
	  println("==============================")
	  println("Execution Address constructor")
	  
	  def getAddress(location_id: Int) = {
		 if (location_id == 1) "Address 1"
		 else if (location_id == 2) "Address 2"       
		 else if (location_id == 3) "Address 3"       
		 else "Other Address"
	  }
	}


	object Demo1 extends App {
		 
	   var e1 = new Emp(100, "Raju", 1)
	   var e2 = new Emp(101, "Ravi", 2)   
			
	   println( Address.getAddress(e1.pLoc) )
	   println( Address.getAddress(e2.pLoc) )
	   println( Address.getAddress(5) )
	}



  Companion object
  ----------------
      -> Is used to add a singlton method for a class
      -> A companion object will have same name as the class and is defined in the same file


  Trait
  -----
      -> Similar to an "interface" in Java, but with some additional features.
      -> A trait can have both abstract and concrete methods.
      -> We can have fields inside a trait
      -> A class can extend any number of traits (but can extend only one class)


  Case class
  ----------
	-> Case Class is a special type of class
	-> It has all the features of a regular class but a few methods will be provided out of box.
	
		-> apply, unapply
		-> toString, hash, copy, equals

	-> Case classes are specifically used for pattern matching. 

 ================================================================================

   Spark
   -----

	-> Is an in-memory distributed computing framework for performing big data analytics
		in-memory -> ability to persist intermediate results in RAM (memory)

	-> Spark in written in SCALA
		
	-> Spark is a 'unified' analytics framework
	
	-> Spark is a polyglot
               Supports Scala, Java, Python and R

	-> Spark apps can run on multiple cluster managers or can run on local machine also
		Spark standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes
	

   Spark unified framework
   -----------------------
	-> Spark provides a consistent set of libraries for performing different analytics workloads
	   using the same execution engine and some well-defined data abstractions


	-> Spark APIs

		Spark Core    	=> Low-level API (RDD API)
		Spark SQL	=> For Batch Processing of structured data
		Spark Streaming	=> For Streaming Ananlytics
		Spark MLLib	=> For Predictive Analytics (Machine Learning)
		Spark GraphX	=> For Graph Parallel Computations


   Spark Architecture
   ------------------

    	1. Cluster Manager
		-> Jobs are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, Standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the SparkContext object
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		2. Cluster : driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
