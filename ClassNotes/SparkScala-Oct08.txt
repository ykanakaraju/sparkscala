  Scala Refresher
  ---------------
  
   => Scala : SCAlable LAnguage
	      Compiler based language (based on Java)
	      Interoperable with Java

   => Scala is a multi-paradigm programming language
	 -> Scala is a "Pure" object oriented prog. lang.
	 -> Scala is a functional programming language

  Pure OOP => Scala does not have primitives and operators

  -> Scala Variables :  immutables -> val
		      mutables  -> var
	-> Scala prefers immutables. 

  -> Scala has implicit type inference

  -> Scala uses infix notation
	obj.method(param) => obj method param

  -> Scala is a statically typed language
	-> Need to know the type of every object at compile type

  Scala is PURE object oriented language
  --------------------------------------
	
      -> Scala does not have primitives or operators.	
      -> In scala, all data is objects and operations are method invocations.

	  val i = 10.*(40)  
   
             -> 10 is an Int object
	     -> * is a method invoked on 10 (Int object)
	     -> 40 is an Int object passed as a parameter
	     -> i is an Int object returned by the * method.
		
      -> <obj>.method<param1> => <obj> method<param1> => <obj> method param1


  -> Blocks
	 => A block any code enclosed in  { }
	 => A block is scala has a return value.
	 => The block returns the value of the last expression that is executed.

         Scala Unit => In Scala "Unit" is an object that represents "no value"
		       prined as "()"

   -> Unit : Is a value class in Scala which represents 'no value'
             Printed as "()"

   -> Scala imports
	
        import scala.io.StdIn		  => single class
        import scala.io.{StdIn, Source}   => multiple classes
	import scala.io._                 => all classes

   -> User Input

		val name = StdIn.readLine("What is your name ?")
    		println("Hello " + name)     
    		println("What is your age ?")
    		val age = StdIn.readInt()
    		println("Age : " + age) 

    -> Output

		printf("Name: %s, age: %2.2f", "Kanakaraju", 47d)
		println(name, age)

    -> String interpolations

		s interpolator: s"Name: $name, Age: ${age + 10}"
		f interpolator: s interpolator + formting chars
				 f"Name: $name, Age: ${age + 10}%2.2f"
		raw interpolator : will escape the escape chars

		 	val filePath = raw"E:\newdir\total\red.txt"
    		 	println(filePath)


   Flow control constructs
   -----------------------

   if..else if.. else

	if statement can return a value
	val x = if (i > 100) "> 100" else if(i < 100)  "< 100" else "== 100"

   match ..case

	   val output = i match {
     		case 10 => "ten"
     		case 20 => "twenty"
     		case 30 => "thirty"
     		case 40 => "fourty"
     		case x if (x % 2 == 0) => s"even number"
     		case y if (y % 2 != 0) => s"odd number"
     		case _  => "no match"
   	   }

  Scala Class Hierarchy
  ---------------------
	Any =>  AnyVal => Int, Double, Long, Char, Byte, Unit, Boolean, ...
            =>  AnyRef => String, List[U], all other classes

  Tuple
  ------

    -> Is a class which can hold multiple elements of different type.
	
	val t1 = (10, 20, 10.5, true, "Hello")
	t1: (Int, Int, Double, Boolean, String) = (10,20,10.5,true,Hello)


	val t2 = (10, List(10, 20, 30), Seq(10.5, 12.2), "hello")
	t2: (Int, List[Int], Seq[Double], String) = (10,List(10, 20, 30),List(10.5, 12.2),hello)

      ** A tuple with two elements is called a "Pair"

     => ArrayBuffer: mutable with variable length

     Immutable Collections
    
        -> Seq  (Sequences)
	     -> Ordered collections and elements can be accessed using an index.

	     -> Indexed Sequences
		 -> Vector
		 -> Range

		 => Optimized for fast random-acccess		

	     -> Linear Sequences
		-> List
		-> Queue
		-> Stream 

		=> Optimized for visiting the elements linearly (i.e in a loop)
		=> They are organized as linked lists
		
		List(1,2,3,4,5,6) => List(1, List(2,3,4,5,6))   
			// here 1 is head, List(2,3,4,5,6) is tail
		        => List(1, List(2, List(3, List(4, List(5, List(6, List())))))) 

		list => List(head, tail)

	-> Set
	     -> Is a unordered collection of unique values.
	     -> We can NOT access the elements using an index.
	     -> SortedSet, BitSet

	-> Map
	     -> A collection of (K, V) pairs

		val m1 = Map( (1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C') )
		val m1 = Map( 1 -> "A", 2 -> "B", 3 -> "C" )

                m1(1) -> "A"
		m1(10) -> raise java.util.NoSuchElementException


  Range

		0 until 10 by 2 => Range(0, 10, 2)
		0 to 10 by 2    => Range(0, 11, 2)

  
  Option
  -------
        -> reprsents an option (i.e value may be or may not be there)
	-> returns instances of 'Some' class or 'None' class


  Loops
  ------

     while

		while( i > 0 ){
            		print(i + " ")

       		    println(s"i = $i, j = $j")
     		}

		for comprehension
		-----------------
		val l1 = for(i <- 1 to 100 by 2) yield(i)


    Exception Handling
    ------------------

        try {
		<some code that could throw an exception>
        }
        catch {
	    case e: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException  => { .... }
	    case e: FileNotFoundException => { .... }
	    case _: Exception => { .... }
			
        }
        finally {
		<some code that is always executed
        }

     Example
     =======

      try {
         println("Reading from a file ...")   
         val f = new FileReader("file1rtyryr.txt")            
      } 
      catch {
         case ex: FileNotFoundException => {
            println("FileNotFoundException exception")
            println( ex.getMessage )
            println( ex.getStackTrace )
         }         
         case _: IOException => {
            println("IO Exception")
         }
         case _: Exception => {
            println("generic exception")
         }
      } 
      finally {
         println("Exiting finally...") 
      }  

       
   Methods
   --------
	
     => method is a reusable code blocks with a name declared using def keyword.

	-> methods can be called by positional arguments
	-> methods can be called by named arguments
	-> method arguments can have default values
	-> methods can take parameter lists

		def f1(a: Int, b: Int)(c: Int) = ( a + b ) * c     
     		val i = f1(10, 20)(30)     
     		println(i)

	-> methods can have one variable length argument (last argument)
		-> You can have default values for args if you are using veriable-length argument

		def sum(a: Int, b: Int*) : Int = {
        		var s = 0
        		for (i <- b) s += i
        		a + s
     		}       
     		val s1 = sum(10)

	-> methods can be called recursivly

		def factorial(n: Int) : Int = {
        		if (n < 2) 1
        		else n * factorial(n - 1)
     		}
     
     		println( factorial(6) )

	-> methods can be nested 

  Procedure
  ---------
     -> Procedure is similar method, but always returns "Unit"
     -> Syntactically there is no "=" symbol in the definition  

	def box(name: String) {
        	val line = "-" * name.length + "----"        
        	println(line + "\n| " + name + " |\n" + line)        
     	}     
     
     	box("Scala is a programming language")


  Function
  --------

	=> A function is treated as a literal value (such as 10, "hello" etc)
	=> A function has a value (of its own)
	=> A function has a type
	=> A function is anonymous (by nature)

	=> A function can be assigned to a variable
		val add = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y

	function literal			function type
        -----------------------------------------------------
	(x: Int, y: Int) => x + y		(Int, Int) => Int
	(x: String, y: Int) => x * y		(String, Int) => String
	() => "Windows 10"			() => String
	(name: String) => println(name)		String => Unit
	(l: List[Int]) => l.sum			List[Int] => Int
	(t: (Int, Int)) => t._1 + t._2		 ((Int, Int)) => Int


        => A function can be passed as argument to another method/function

		def calculate(a: Int, b: Int, f: (Int, Int) => Int) = {
       			f(a, b)
     		}
		val result = calculate(345, 20, (x: Int, y: Int) => x % y)     
     		println( result )

       => A method/function can return a function as its return value
		-> A block can return a function as final value
	
		def compute(op: String) = {       
       			op match {
          			case "+" => (x : Int, y: Int) => x + y
          			case "-" => (x : Int, y: Int) => x - y
          			case "*" => (x : Int, y: Int) => x * y
          			case "/" => (x : Int, y: Int) => x / y
          			case _ => (x : Int, y: Int) => x % y
       			}       
     		}        
     		println( compute("+")(321, 10) )


   Higher Order Functions
   ----------------------
	=> Take a function as an argument
	=> Applied on some Iterable object. 

   1. map		P: U => V
			Transforms each object of the input to another obejct in the output
			input: N elements, output: N element

		l1.map( s => s.split(" ").length )

   2. filter		P: U => Boolean
			The output collection will have only those objects for which the funtion
			returns true. 
			input: N elements, output: <= N element

		l4.filter( t => t._1 + t._2 >= 10 )

   3. flatMap		P: U => GenTraversableOnce[V]    (U => Collection)
			flattens the output of the function
			input: N elements, output: >= N element

		words.flatMap(x => x.toUpperCase)

    4. reduce        => reduceLeft (reduce) & reduceRight
			P: (U, U) => U
			Reduces the entire input collection to one value of the 'same type' by 'iterativly
			applying' the function

		List(2,1,2,4,5,4,3,2).reduce( (x, y) => x - y )  => 23
		
    5. sortWith		P: binary sorting function
			Elements of the collections are sorted based on the sorting function.

		l4.sortWith( (m,n) => m._1 > n._1 )  
    
     6. groupBy		P: U => V
			Returns a Map objects, where
			   key: Each unique value of the function output
			   value: List object containing all the objects that produced the key.

			List[U].groupBy( U => V ) => Map[ V, List[U] ]

     7. mapValues	P: U => V
			Applied only on (key, value) pairs i.e Map objects
			It will transform only the value of the (K, V) pairs

			val m2 = m1.mapValues( x => (x,x) )

     8. fold		=> foldLeft (fold) & foldRight
		
  
  WordCount Program

  ========================================================  
    Spark
  ========================================================

   => Spark is an in-memory distributed computing framework.

   	 Cluster => A unified entity containing many nodes whose cumulative resources can be used to
               	    distribute store and/or computations of big data. 

     	in-memory computing -> The intermediate results of distributed computing can be saved in-memory
			       and subsequent tasks can run on these saved partitions. 

        => Spark is 100x faster than MapReduce if you use 100% in-memory processing
	   Spark is 6 t 7x faster than MapReduce even if you use disk based processing

   => Spark is written in Scala. 

   => Spark is a polyglot
	-> Support supports Scala, Java, Python and R

   => Spark provides a "Unified framework" for analytical workloads

	Spark provides a set of consistent APIs that can used to process different analytical workloads
	based on the same execution engine. 

	 -> Batch Analytics on unstructured data	: Spark Core API
	 -> Batch Analytics on structured data		: Spark SQL
	 -> Stream Analytics (real-time processing)	: Spark Streaming, Strcutured Streaming
	 -> Predistive analytics (using ML)		: Spark MLlib
	 -> Graph parallel computations			: Spark GraphX

   => Spark applications can be submitted to multiple cluster managers
	=> local, spark standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes 
	

    Spark Architecture
    ------------------

    	1. Cluster Manager
		-> Jobs are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the SparkContext object
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		2. Cluster : driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
		-> receives the tasks from the Driver
		-> all tasks runs the same execution code but on different partitions of the data
		-> the status of tasks os reported to the driver.


   Getting started with Spark
